**Table of Contents**

[TOC]
 
## Programme Overview

The Skills and Training Team have collaborated with the Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) Research Programme to launch **the TPS Training and Peer-mentoring programme** at The Alan Turing Institute.

The TPS peer-mentoring and training programme will run for 8 weeks, featuring practical concepts from *[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)* across four themes:
* Project Design
* Reproducibility and Collaboration 
* Project management
* Ethical Research

**KEY DATES** 
* **Eligibility**: Applicants of this pilot programme should be affiliated with the Turing
* **Applications open:** [Tuesday, 12 April - Sunday, 22 May 2022](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=p_SVQ1XklU-Knx-672OE-etitOjG6rhHtlIU40dhvK9URUdaUTMxT0czMUZNSFBXVUpDVks5SURPTC4u)
* **Pre-Application Webinar and Drop-in session:** Thursday, 28 April 2022 @ 12:30, Zoom Link: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/97248428609?pwd=S1NuOVhQRFg0RU91ODVlckgxZU9PUT09, Meeting ID: 972 4842 8609, Passcode: 789019)
* **Programme duration:** Wednesday, 1 June - Wednesday, 20 July 2022

**Who should apply?** This programme is designed for students, researchers and research infrastructure roles at the Turing. 

By [research infrastructure roles](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles.html) in this programme, we mean teams within the business, community engagement, research applications, research engineering, data stewardship or other positions where individuals may see themselves in research support or advisory roles.

## Format and Schedule

Each topic will host two sets of calls, **alternating between a training workshop and a peer-mentoring session**, hosted by the Skills and Training team on Wednesdays between 1 June to 27 July 2022 with experts from the broader Turing community leading different sessions.


### Training

Training calls will provide hands-on insight into the various projects and ways of working in data science and research infrastucture supported by resources, tools and templates from the Turing to help you advance in your projects.

### Peer-Mentoring

Peer-led discussions and mentoring sessions will provide the opportunity to reflect on lessons and insights gained from the previous week’s training call. Programme participants will come together in smaller groups and discuss how the training applies to their own research/projects with additional communication channels to provide further opportunities for knowledge sharing.



### What will you learn?

This programme will cover priority areas of interest identified through our community assessment survey. Below we share highlights and topics from the survey selected for this pilot programme.

## What’s in it for you :question:

The aim of this programme is to promote and incorporate the principles of The Turing Way across the broader Turing community to nurture open research design, collaboration and community-driven interactions. 

At the end of this programme, we hope both participants and trainers can gain: 
- New connections and increased from support from the Turing community 
- Understanding of the breadth of roles, research and projects across teams
- Knowledge of the tools, practices and systems used by the community to drive open source and reproducible work 
- Accountability and structure to your research and/or projects with templates, resources and prompts 
- Insights into the breadth of work that exists across teams and clear guidance on how to get involved in projects
- Become a contributing member of learners, trainers and collaborators in the training community 


### Syllabus and content 

All **content is adapted from different chapters in The Turing Wa**y handbook and contextualised to the research and work happening across the Turing.

The programme features topics covering effective project planning and management, communications and collaboration, interdisciplinarity and embedding ethical practices. 

- :nut_and_bolt: **Project Design**: Roadmaps, goal setting and version control
